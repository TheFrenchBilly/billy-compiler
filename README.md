# Why this compiler exist ?

Because i always wanted to create a compiler and now i can say that I did it. The compiler is definitely not perfect and doesn't probably look like the others compilers. 

The "__billy__" language does not support a lot of stuff but just enough to do a tic-tac-toe in console. For example, the language don't have class, operation priority and function parameter. But you can still use recursivity. And there is no NULL !

```
Integer i	

main()
	loop()
	classicLoop()
	
loop()
	if i < 100:
		i = i + 1
		print(i + " ")
		loop()
	elseif true:
		printLine("done")
	
classicLoop()
	for Integer i = 1; i < 101;i = i + 1:
		print(i + " ")
	printLine("done")
```

For more billy code example see the folder __"src/test/resources/integration/"__. The code for the tic-tac-toe is there.

# How to use the compiler?

First, you have the to build the jar. To do so you will have to run maven with the goal package.

```
mvn package
```
When you have the jar you juste to execute with java.

```
java -jar BillyCompiler.jar helloWorld.billy
```
The execution will always produce a file name "Main.class" and then you can run it with java.

```
java Main
```
If you want to see the generated byte code.

```
javap -verbose Main
```


__Will you add more feature ?__ I dont know, maybe.

__Why there not enough unit test?__ Because I did it for fun and that's fine.

__Does the compiler have bugs ?__ Yeah, probably.
